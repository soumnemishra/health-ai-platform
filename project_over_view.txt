Overall Idea and Approach from Files and Discussion
Problem Addressed:
Physicians struggle to keep up with fast-growing, complex, and diverse medical literature across specialties (oncology, cardiology, neurology, etc.).
The complexity involves filtering relevant journals, understanding academic vs layman perspectives, and timely receiving high-impact updates.

Proposed Solution:

An AI-powered alert system that delivers filtered, specialty-wise journal updates.

Each journal update includes:

An academic summary (detailed, clinician-focused)

A layman summary (easy to understand)

A mixed overview (eye-catching, quick insight)

User can click for more insights or listen/watch multimedia summaries (podcast, video snippet).

Researcher profiles with rankings at global, country, state, city, and department levels based on contributions.

AI-driven personalized recommendations to help researchers improve ranking and support paper writing.

Integration with open research APIs like OpenAlex for automated data ingestion and profile management with manual correction options.

Technical Components (as per your .txt file):

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture for evidence retrieval combined with natural language generation.

Multi-agent AI framework that breaks down user queries and aggregates results.

Clarification layer to ask additional patient-specific or context questions to improve answers.

Reference highlighting to enable citations linking directly to relevant journal sections.

Integration with databases like PubMed, OpenAlex, and custom indexing using vector databases for semantic search.

Daily ingestion pipelines to keep repository updated with new publications.

User interface features for alerts, detailed article views, researcher profiles, and gamification components.

From the .md file (Web of Medicine AI User Flows):

Detailed user flows for the application including search, filtering by specialization, detailed research card display with multiple summary tabs.

Researcher profile flows including scoring/ranking dashboards, personalized improvement checklists, and monetization pathways.

Backend ETL pipelines handle data extraction, filtering using evidence quality, update schedules, scoring components, and rankings.

API design covering specialized search, article detail retrieval, user profile handling, and scoring engines.

Frontend components with accessible, searchable UI optimized for usability by clinicians and researchers.

What You Can Contribute as an AI and ML Engineer
AI Model Design and Development:

Design and fine-tune language models (LLMs) specialized for medical summarization for academic, layman, and blended summaries.

Build the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for accurate evidence retrieval with transparent citations.

Develop multi-agent AI systems for complex query decomposition, clarification asking, and evidence synthesis.

Implement personalized recommendation systems for researcher ranking improvements and support in paper writing (e.g., suggesting relevant citations, improving language).

Data Pipeline and Integration:

Build and optimize data ingestion pipelines from OpenAlex, PubMed APIs, and other sources for nightly or daily updates.

Create vector embeddings and indexing for efficient semantic search and filtering by specialty, evidence quality, publication date.

Researcher Profile and Scoring Algorithms:

Develop algorithms for scoring and ranking researchers across various granularity levels (global/state/institution/specialty).

Use AI to generate personalized actionable insights, checklists, and gamification features to motivate researchers.

User Interaction and Explanation:

Implement AI layers that generate multi-level patient- and clinician-friendly explanations, including interactive question asking to clarify contexts (clarification layer).

Enable transparency and auditability by linking outputs to exact journal text with clickable highlights.

Tooling and Repositories:

Use notebook-based environments for experimentation with models and data exploration (e.g., fine-tuning models, interactive querying).

Organize code repositories and write clear documentation for collaborative development and deployment pipelines.

Collaboration With Domain Experts:

Work closely with clinicians and researchers to iteratively validate summaries, AI recommendations, and ranking logic performance.

Incorporate expert feedback into training data refinement and model enhancements.

What the Files Provide and How They Fit Together
The .txt file provides detailed research and architectural notes, improvement ideas inspired by Vera Health AI and other systems, with example implementation prompts and system design at a deep technical level. It contains conceptual and engineering plans, including sample prompts for code generation tools, interaction design, and enhancements like reference highlighting and clarification layers.

The .md file concretely lays out user flows, backend and frontend architecture, data model designs, ETL pipelines, API surface, and scoring logic for researcher gamification—essentially a full product and engineering specification for an MVP or production system.

Together, these files form a blueprint for your doctor’s vision: a comprehensive AI-powered medical research alert and profiling system with strong user experience, transparency, dynamic interactive AI, and robust backend integration.

Summary
The idea is to develop a next-generation clinical and medical research alert system that:

Filters and streams up-to-date medical research journal content by specialty

Generates multi-level summaries (academic, layman, blended) and multimedia content

Maintains dynamic researcher profiles with rankings and AI-driven improvement guidance

Integrates through APIs like OpenAlex and PubMed for data ingestion and updating

Uses retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent AI for semantic search and question clarification

Provides transparency with citation linking and source text highlighting

Supports clinician-friendly UI and research gamification features

As an AI/ML engineer, you bring critical expertise in language model development, semantic search, AI multi-agent orchestration, recommendation systems, and ML-driven scoring. You can drive the technical design, model training, pipeline automation, and interactive AI features alongside clinicians and developers to bring this vision to reality.
